Social Structure of Mining Pools

There are three main "types" of mining that occur.

1. Solo mining
What kind of hardware/software do I need as a solo machine?
Nvidia graphics card --> u can do mining urself!
Example 1:
Example 2:

2. Centralized pool
Names, websites, analysis of what they're extracting. How much are they charging. Who's getting which blocks? Which wallets getting?

3. Distributed p2p pool
Mostly btc//eth pools. Distributed p2p pooling not offered for sc yet. 0% payout.

All miners get paid at true expectation value.
